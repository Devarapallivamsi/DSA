#Given an array of numbers,find Second smallest and second largest elements.
# optimal approach:
import math

small = math.inf
secondSmall = math.inf
large = -math.inf
secLarge = -math.inf

nums = [1, 2, 4, 7, 7, 5]

for i in nums:
    if i > large:
        large, secLarge = i, large
    elif i > secLarge and i != large:
        secLarge = i

    if i < small:
        small, secondSmall = i, small
    elif i < secondSmall and i != secondSmall:
        secondSmall = i

print(secLarge)
print(secondSmall)
